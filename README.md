# Sudoku Solver
Simple sudoku solver made with python 3. The script is pretty easy to use.
* Just clone the repository
* Execute the script
* When prompted, just input the sudoku from left to right and top to bottom.

This script has not been optimized with list comprehension or speed improvement but
a simple profiler should easily identify any bottleneck. Enjoy!
